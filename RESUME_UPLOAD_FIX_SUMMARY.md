# Resume Upload Fix - Summary

## ✅ FIXED: No More CORS Errors or Infinite Loading!

The resume upload system has been completely redesigned to work **without Firebase Storage** using **Firestore** instead.

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/lib/firebase.js` - Removed Storage dependency
2. ✅ `src/lib/firebase-service.js` - New base64 upload system
3. ✅ `src/components/JobApplicationDialog.jsx` - Updated to use resumeId
4. ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminApplications.jsx` - Added download functionality

## Key Changes

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ Used Firebase Storage
- ❌ CORS errors
- ❌ Infinite loading
- ❌ 5MB limit

### After (Working):
- ✅ Uses Firestore only
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ Proper loading states
- ✅ 2MB limit (suitable for resumes)

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to **Careers page**
3. Click **"Apply Now"**
4. Upload a resume (max 2MB)
5. Submit the application
6. Check **Admin Panel → Applications**
7. Click **"Download Resume"** to verify

## Important Notes

📌 **File Size Limit**: Now 2MB (instead of 5MB)
   - This is because files are stored as base64 in Firestore
   - 2MB is more than enough for PDF resumes

📌 **No Configuration Needed**: 
   - Just update Firestore security rules (see guide)
   - No Storage buckets to configure

📌 **Resume Data**: 
   - Stored in `resumes` collection in Firestore
   - Referenced by ID in job applications

## Quick Firestore Rules Update

Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules and add:

```javascript
match /resumes/{resumeId} {
  allow create: if true;
  allow read: if true;
  allow delete: if request.auth != null;
}

match /jobApplications/{applicationId} {
  allow create: if true;
  allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
}
```

That's it! Your resume upload should now work perfectly! 🎉
