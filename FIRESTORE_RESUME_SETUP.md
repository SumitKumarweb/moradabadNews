# Firestore Resume Upload Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed - Resume Upload Using Firestore

Since you don't have Firebase Storage enabled, the resume upload system has been redesigned to use **Firestore** to store resumes as base64-encoded data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/lib/firebase.js`)
- ‚úÖ Removed Firebase Storage dependency
- ‚úÖ Using only Firestore, Auth, and Analytics

### 2. Upload Function (`src/lib/firebase-service.js`)
- ‚úÖ Converts files to base64 format
- ‚úÖ Stores resume data in Firestore `resumes` collection
- ‚úÖ File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX only)
- ‚úÖ File size validation (2MB max - reduced for base64 storage)
- ‚úÖ Returns document ID instead of URL
- ‚úÖ Added `getResume()` function to retrieve resume data

### 3. Job Application Dialog (`src/components/JobApplicationDialog.jsx`)
- ‚úÖ Updated to use `resumeId` instead of `resumeUrl`
- ‚úÖ Changed file size limit from 5MB to 2MB
- ‚úÖ Updated all validation and error messages
- ‚úÖ Better user feedback during upload

### 4. Admin Applications Page (`src/pages/admin/AdminApplications.jsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added download functionality for base64 resumes
- ‚úÖ Converts base64 back to original file format
- ‚úÖ Downloads with proper filename and extension
- ‚úÖ Changed icon from ExternalLink to Download

## How It Works

### For Job Applicants:
1. User uploads resume (PDF, DOC, or DOCX)
2. File is validated (type and size)
3. File is converted to base64 string
4. Data is saved in Firestore `resumes` collection
5. Document ID is stored with the job application

### For Admins:
1. Admin views job applications
2. Clicks "Download Resume" button
3. System fetches resume from Firestore by ID
4. Base64 data is converted back to file
5. File downloads automatically with proper name

## Firestore Data Structure

### `resumes` Collection
```javascript
{
  fileName: "sanitized_file_name.pdf",
  originalName: "Original File Name.pdf",
  fileType: "application/pdf",
  fileSize: 123456, // bytes
  base64Data: "data:application/pdf;base64,...",
  uploadedAt: "2025-10-13T10:30:00.000Z",
  timestamp: 1760338652203
}
```

### `jobApplications` Collection
```javascript
{
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "1234567890",
  githubId: "johndoe",
  linkedinId: "johndoe",
  coverLetter: "...",
  resumeId: "abc123...", // Reference to resumes collection
  jobId: "job123",
  jobTitle: "Software Engineer",
  status: "pending",
  appliedAt: "2025-10-13T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## File Size Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: File size is limited to **2MB** (instead of 5MB) because:
- Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33%
- Firestore has a 1MB document size limit
- We store the base64 string in a single document field
- 2MB original file ‚âà 2.67MB encoded (still within safe limits)

## Security Rules

Update your Firestore security rules to allow resume uploads:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Allow anyone to create job applications
    match /jobApplications/{applicationId} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow anyone to create resumes (for job applications)
    match /resumes/{resumeId} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read: if true; // Admins need to download
      allow delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Other collections - admin only
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go to Careers page**
3. **Click "Apply Now" on any job**
4. **Upload a resume** (max 2MB)
5. **Fill out the form** and submit
6. **Check Admin Panel** ‚Üí Applications
7. **Click "Download Resume"** to test download

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- File uploads successfully
- Green checkmark appears with filename
- Submit button becomes enabled
- Application submits without errors
- Resume downloads correctly in admin panel

### ‚ùå Error Cases:
- **File too large**: "File size exceeds 2MB limit"
- **Invalid file type**: "Invalid file type. Please upload PDF, DOC, or DOCX files only."
- **Network error**: Specific Firebase error message

## Advantages of This Approach

‚úÖ **No Firebase Storage needed** - Uses only Firestore (which you already have)
‚úÖ **No CORS issues** - Everything goes through Firestore API
‚úÖ **Simple setup** - No additional Firebase services to configure
‚úÖ **Works immediately** - No storage buckets to configure
‚úÖ **Self-contained** - Resume data lives with application data

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **File size**: Limited to 2MB (instead of 5MB with Storage)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost**: Firestore charges per document read/write (usually negligible)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Scalability**: For high volume, Firebase Storage would be better

## Upgrading to Firebase Storage (Optional)

If you want to enable Firebase Storage later for larger files:

1. Enable Storage in Firebase Console
2. Revert to the previous upload implementation
3. Set up CORS rules
4. Migrate existing base64 resumes to Storage

For now, the Firestore approach is perfect for your use case! üéâ

## Troubleshooting

### Upload not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firestore rules allow `resumes` collection writes
3. Check file size is under 2MB
4. Try a different file

### Download not working:
1. Check admin is logged in
2. Verify resume document exists in Firestore
3. Check browser console for base64 conversion errors
4. Try clearing browser cache

### Performance issues:
- Base64 conversion is done in browser (client-side)
- May be slow for files close to 2MB
- Consider showing progress indicator for large files
